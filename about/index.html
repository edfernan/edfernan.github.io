  <h1 class="styled-header">About Me</h1>
  <p>As a native of the Napa Valley, people always asked if my family owned a winery. They didn't and I likely won't either in my lifetime. I did however spend part of my childhood living on a vineyard taking  my mom's cooking to my dad during lunch hour on a little blue bicycle. Being the son of immigrants provided me with experiences that were personally ordinary yet provided me a perspective to view problems from a different lense. With hard work and supportive people who invested in me along the way, I now work in user experience and service design trying to unravel complex problems to build a better tomorrow.</p>

  <p>In my 5 years as a UX professional, I've been fortunate to help Spanish-speaking patients navigate health challenges, help job-seekers apply for new career opportunities, and give back to <a href="https://www.summersearch.org/">community organizations</a>.</p>
