  <h1 class="styled-header">About Me</h1>
  <p>As a UX Researcher and Service Designer with 10 years of experience, I thrive in complex problem spaces and put organizations in their user's shoes. With a diverse background in 9 markets, I've honed my skills in handling projects that influence key business decisions. My work fosters collaboration and drives high engagement across teams, weaving insights from research, design, data science, and business partners.</p>

  <p>Growing up on a vineyard in Napa Valley, I gained a unique perspective as the son of immigrants that is uncommon in tech. Through my work, I've helped Spanish-speaking patients navigate health challenges, assisted job-seekers in applying for new opportunities, and given back to community organizations. My research leads to insights that help build a future worth designing, one that is inclusive and accessible to all.</p>
