  <p>As a native to the Napa Valley, I gained a unique perspective as the son of immigrants. Through my work and life, I've helped Spanish-speaking patients navigate health challenges, assisted job-seekers in applying for new opportunities, and given back to community organizations. My research leads to insights that help build a future worth designing, one that is inclusive and accessible to all.</p>
