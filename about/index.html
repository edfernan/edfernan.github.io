  <h1 class="styled-header">About Me</h1>
  <p>Born and raised in the Napa Valley to Mexican immigrants, I've come to experience understand problems that often go unseen. Fortunately I've been able to translate those life skills into a meaningful career in UX: helping Spanish-speaking be better informed about their health, helping job-seekers apply for new career opportunities, as well as giving back to community programs I'm involved with. I'm always seeking to lead, support, and collaborate in ways that make an impact and solve important problems.</p>
