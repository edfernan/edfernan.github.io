  <h1 class="styled-header">About Me</h1>
  <p>Being born and raised in the Napa Valley, people always ask if my family owned a winery. They don't and I likely won't in my lifetime. However I spent part of my childhood living on a vineyard taking my mom's cooking to my dad working in the fields on a little blue bicycle. Those experiences as the son of immigrants provide me perspectives that aren't common in the tech scene. With hard work and supportive people who have invested in me along the way, I now work in user experience and service design trying to unravel complex problems to build a better tomorrow.</p>

  <p>In my 5 years as a UX professional, I've been fortunate enough to help Spanish-speaking patients navigate health challenges, help job-seekers apply for new career opportunities, and give back to <a href="https://www.summersearch.org/">community organizations</a>.</p>
