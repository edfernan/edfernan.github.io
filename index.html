  <h3>Video Visits</h3>
  <p>Survey | User Interviews</p>
  <p>The research conducted for Video Visits identified potential painpoints for the product team to address in future iterations. This led to a roadmap of improvements that streamline the user flows. Video Visits is a complex product as it mixes service design, and interaction design in a variety of supported platforms.</p>

  <h3>My Doctor Online: Cold and Flu</h3>
  <p>Participatory Design Sessions</p>
  <p>The "Cold and Flu" section of My Doctor Online is intended to help patients get a flu vaccination and guide patients on the best way to care for their cold/flu symptoms. This research project helped gather an understanding of how patients utilize Kaiser Permanente resources and provide strategies to reduce the number of patients who seek medical care for symptoms that do not require clinical intervention.</p>
