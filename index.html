  <p class="text1 center">&iexcl;Hola!</p>

  <p>As a <em class="inline-em">Senior UX Researcher</em> with 10 years of industry expertise, I thrive in using research to develop effective strategies for 0-to-1 and existing products. With a diverse background conducting research in 9 different markets, I have honed my skills in handling complex projects that influence key business decisions across product and strategy.</p>

  <p>My work fosters strong cross-functional relationships and collaboration among team members. My research has a reputation for driving high engagement across teams, and weaving together insights from research, design, data science, and business partners. By leveraging diverse data sources and linking them to specific business needs, I am able to shape experimentation, product, and strategy in a cohesive and impactful way.</p>
