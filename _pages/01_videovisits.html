description: The research conducted for Video Visits identified potential painpoints for the product team to address in future iterations. This led to a roadmap of improvements that streamline the user flows. Video Visits is a complex product as it mixes service design, and interaction design in a variety of supported platforms.

<p>Video Visits is a service that allows Kaiser Permanente patients to get faster access to care using a computer or mobile device video capabilities.</p>

<p>The research project was intended to help further streamline the Video Visits process. Video Visits is a complex product as it mixes service design, and interaction design in a variety of supported platforms.</p>


<h2>At a Glance</h2>

<h3>Project Team</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Lead Researcher: Me</li>
  <li>Two additional research assistants</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goal of Project</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Identify what factor(s) may be leading to unsuccessful Video Visits</li>
  <li>Provide actionable recommendations to improve connection rates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Outcomes</h3>

<h3></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Two new features</li>
  <li>Improved Video Visit onboarding</li>
  <li>Findings became a key factor in renaming the mobile app from "KP Preventive Care" to "My Doctor Online"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Determining Research Scope</h2>
<p>I met with the Video Visits team to discuss what they wanted to learn and what decisions needed to be informed. At this time, I also requested data logs to get an idea of what was happening with Video Visits from a quantitative perspective. From the discussions and the analysis of the data I learned...</p>

<h3>Project Challenges</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No clear consensus from the team about what parts of the process were problematic for users</li>
  <li>Owners of specific parts of the service wanted to prioritize and validate their own hypothesis</li>
  <li>Quantitative data was owned by different teams, and was not easily accessible.</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>We wanted to identify contributing factors that reduced Video Visit success rates. In order to increase the rate of connection, we chose to targeted three groups.</p>

<ul>
  <li>"Patient did not join": The clinician joined, but the patient did not.</li>
  <li>"Neither joined": A scheduled Video Visit that neither the patient nor clinician joined.</li>
  <li>"Joined but missed": A Video Visit where both parties connected to Video Visits, but were not on at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Developing Study Approach</h2>
<p>The lack of consensus on where to focus the study led me to evaluate the entire service as a whole. My methods would have to allow me to identify potential pain points at any point in the experience. Then after finding some patterns, I could get more in-depth information on those specific problems from patients.</p>

<h3>1st Method: Survey</h3>
<p>A survey provided us easy access to a large pool of patients who had recently scheduled a Video Visit. I designed a survey with quantitative questions to test specific hypothesis with finite possibilities, and open-ended questions to identify potential pain points across the the Video Visits experience.</p>

<h3>2nd Method: User Interviews</h3>
<p>With the help of some colleagues, we conducted follow-up interviews with survey respondents. We were able to gather insights about a users experience from the point they scheduled an appointment, all the way to when they could not connect with their doctor.</p>

<h2>Key Research Findings</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Patients did not know where to access Video Visits.</li>
  <li>Patients used the wrong Kaiser Permanente app due to similarities in the app name.</li>
  <li>High response rates from patients whose doctor never arrived to their appointment (Using data logs, we confirmed that in many cases the doctor was simply late).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Results</h2>
<ul>
  <li>New clinician-facing feature allowing them to notify patients of a late start</li>
  <li>New email that gets sent before their appointment giving them direct access points to the web app or mobile app for Video Visits</li>
  <li>Research became a key factor in renaming the "KP Preventive Care" app to "My Doctor Online"</li>
</ul>
