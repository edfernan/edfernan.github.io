Summer Search is a national college success organization that works to close the opportunity gap for low-income students with high potential by helping transform what they believe is possible. As an alumnus of the Summer Search program, I have been giving back my time and skills as a member of the Bay Area Alumni Board where I am in my second year as the chair.

## Alumni Board Interviews
Prior to the workshop, I conducted 1-hour interviews with all 10 members of the 2015 - 2016 alumni board cohort to learn about their perspectives and inform our thinking about the needs of our workshop.

- How were they feeling about the board overall?
- What were the highlights for them individually and together as a group?
- How might we improve in the following year?
- What does success look like to them?

## Quick Findings

- Members felt the Alumni Board needed to develop a clear role and mission within the broader Summer Search program.
- Expected there to be opportunities for members to utilize their specific strengths and being able to support other initiatives more generally.
- Members wanted to create measurable impact throughout their tenure on the Alumni Board.

## Organizing the Workshop
I met with Molly to discuss the findings from the interviews and how we would start heading in that direction in an organic way. We wanted to insure that the Alumni Board was creating ideas as opposed to be directed by internal leadership or Summer Search staff.

Afterwards, we met with Summer Search staff to compile any data (background info, quantitative data, and qualitative data) about the Summer Search alumni community for board members. This data was important for giving all of our members, particularly newer members, enough context before entering our workshop.

Molly and I decided to take the following approach for the workshop.

- Idea Generation: What do we want to do in 2017?
- Narrow Ideas: Which ideas are good starting points for further ideation?
- Goals: What goals do these ideas accomplish?
- Plan: Create a high-level proposal to the group.
- Narrow again: What ideas best meet the goals of the group, and should we focus on.
